## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of Information Systems (IS) and Applied Data Science, specifically focusing on how advanced computational technologies can be leveraged to augment business decision-making and how their economic impacts can be rigorously quantified.

1. Augmenting Business Decisions through AI & Optimization
Core Technologies: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Mathematical Optimization.

- Focus: Developing and implementing intelligent systems that solve complex business problems. I focus on the "How"—innovating with technical tools to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of organizational decision-making processes.

2. Causal Inference & Impact Evaluation
Methodology: Causal Inference, Econometrics, and Prescriptive Analytics.

- Focus: Moving beyond simple correlations to understand the "Why." I utilize causal inference frameworks to measure the substantive impact of IT implementations on business performance, consumer behavior, and market dynamics.

3. Economic Value of Intelligent Systems
- Focus: Quantifying the ROI and strategic value of technological innovation. My work aims to bridge the gap between technical capability and business strategy, providing empirical evidence on how AI-driven systems transform traditional economic models.
