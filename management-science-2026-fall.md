**kau-ms-tutor** is your study companion for Management Science. Install the tutor, give it a name of your own, and explore the course materials with it.

### Install AI Tutor

**[Download AI Tutor](/assets/teaching/management-science-2026-fall/kau-ms-tutor.zip)**

Download the tutor package, then upload it to Claude using the steps below. The package includes the tutor instructions and all 22 course references.

1. In Claude, enable **Settings → Capabilities → Code execution and file creation** (or **Create and edit files**).
2. Open **Customize → Skills → Create skill → Upload a skill**, upload the ZIP, and enable **kau-ms-tutor**. In the updated interface, look under **Plugins**.
3. **Start a new chat** and send the two prompts below, one at a time.

Your installed skill remains available for future chats, subject to your AI service’s settings and your own account’s usage limits. It includes a snapshot of the course text: import a new ZIP when materials are updated, then start a new chat. [Claude installation guide](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512180-use-skills-in-claude).

#### First prompt — Name your tutor

Copy this prompt into your new chat. Choose a name when the tutor asks you.

> Use kau-ms-tutor as my Management Science study tutor. Let me give you a name: ask what I would like to call you, then wait for my answer. Once I choose, use that name in this conversation and briefly explain how you can help me learn.

The name is your personal nickname for the tutor. In a new chat, remind it of your chosen name if needed.

#### Second prompt — Explore your course materials

After naming your tutor, send this prompt to check which materials it can actually read.

> Use kau-ms-tutor and inspect the course references included in the installed skill. List the available materials by week or topic, including the syllabus, lecture slides, quizzes and examples, assignments, CVXPY practice, and released solutions. Read each accessible reference and give a brief summary of what it covers without solving any problems. Distinguish files you actually read from titles you could only list, and clearly identify anything inaccessible. Do not guess missing contents. Finish by asking which topic I would like to study first.

Figures and mathematical notation may require the original documents below.

### Course materials

All course materials are organized by week below. Problem sets include quizzes, additional examples, and assignments, with released solutions alongside them. Select **View notebook** to read formatted cells, or **Download** to run a notebook in VS Code, Jupyter, or Google Colab.
